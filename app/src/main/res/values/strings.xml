    <string name="treble_version_header">Version</string>
    <string name="treble_lite_header">VNDK Lite</string>
    <string name="treble_legacy_header">Legacy</string>
    <string name="treble_version_explanation">This is the version of the Vendor Native Development Kit used to build your device\'s vendor partition. It represents the lowest Android version that can be installed on the system partition.</string>
    <string name="treble_lite_explanation">VNDK Lite disables some isolation between the system and vendor partitions at runtime, resulting in a smaller but less versatile vendor partition.</string>
    <string name="treble_legacy_explanation">On vendors built with Android 8.1 or lower, a legacy path is used for the device manifest.</string>
    <string name="treble_explanation">Project Treble allows supported Android devices to boot a Generic System Image, reducing the time required for updates to be developed.</string>
    <string name="filename_explanation">This is the name of the Generic System Image required by your device. Names may vary slightly. Click here to browse some Generic System Images created by the community.</string>
    <string name="sar_explanation">The system partition can be mounted either as the root filesystem (System-as-Root) or in a subdirectory of the root ramdisk (System-as-System). Many GSIs incorrectly refer to this property as A/B. If a device uses System-as-Root, it requires an A/B GSI. Otherwise, it requires an A-only GSI.</string>
    <string name="ab_explanation">Although many GSIs refer to A/B images, this value is not directly linked to the GSI image type. Devices with A/B partitions are able to store two copies of Android at once. This allows updating one copy while the other is in use.</string>
    <string name="dynamicpartitions_explanation">Devices with Dynamic Partitions are able to create, modify or delete partitions during updates. To support this feature, a \"super\" partition is used. This container partition contains all other partitions except for the bootloader. Flashing must be performed using fastbootd on these devices.</string>

    <string name="vabc_false">Your device does not use compressed Virtual A/B partitioning.</string>
    <string name="vabc_true">Your device uses compressed Virtual A/B partitioning.</string>
    <string name="vab_header">Virtual A/B</string>
    <string name="vab_explanation">Virtual A/B allows a device to perform Seamless Upgrades without needing to permanently keep two copies of Android.</string>
    <string name="vabr_header">Virtual A/B Retrofit</string>
    <string name="vabr_explanation">Devices with retrofitted Virtual A/B have empty space in the super partition.</string>
    <string name="vabc_header">Virtual A/B Compression</string>
    <string name="vabc_explanation">On devices that use Virtual A/B, the changes made can be compressed. This reduces performance but decreases storage requirements during the update.</string>
    <string name="arch_explanation">The architecture of the CPU determines which programs can be run on the device, and must match the operating system. The binder architecture controls how programs communicate. Since the vendor partition programs need to communicate with the system partition programs, the binder architecture must match between the two.</string>
