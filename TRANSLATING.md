# Contributing translations

## Translation Guidelines

- Please stick to the intended meaning of the English text as much as possible.
- Where a direct translation is not possible, use the text that makes the most sense for native readers of the language.
- If you are in any doubt about a translation, please use the comments feature on PoEditor or send an email.
- Any incomplete, doubtful or uncertain translations must be marked [fuzzy](https://poeditor.com/kb/fuzzy-translations#kb-article-title).

## Moderation

All strings are audited before release. This is to prevent vandalism. Anyone defacing the translations will be blocked from the project. Repeated inaccurate translations are also grounds for removal.
